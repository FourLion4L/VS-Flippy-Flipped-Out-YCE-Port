I own none of the assets (with an exception of explosion sprites which appear on the screen). All credit goes to the original mod and its developers.

# How is this pesky ugly port any different from the original mod?

  Well, this port includes several extra features, including:
- (Toggleable) Modcharts (on-screen effects to make gameplay more engaging!) made for every separate song included in this port
- Several (Toggleable) reworked mechanics to further diverse the gameplay and expand upon original ideas of the original VS Flippy: Flipped Out! mod
- Achievements
