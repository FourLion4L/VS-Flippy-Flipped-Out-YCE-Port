# VS Flippy: Flipped Out! YoshiCrafterEngine Port+

‚ö†Ô∏è THIS PORT IS NOT OFFICIAL ‚ö†Ô∏è

I own none of the assets (with an exception of explosion sprites which appear on the screen). All credit goes to the original mod and its developers.

## How is this pesky ugly port any different from the original mod?

‚ÑπÔ∏è Well, this port includes several extra features, starring:
- (Toggleable) Modcharts (on-screen effects to make gameplay more engaging!) made for every separate song included in this port
- Several (Toggleable) reworked mechanics to further diverse the gameplay and expand upon original ideas of the original VS Flippy: Flipped Out! mod
- 16 BRAND NEW ACHIEVEMENTS, some of which are easy to get, some with a progression to be made, and some are even hidden, so have fun unlocking all sixteen!
- Reimagined title screen with different characters and a semi-secret functionality üòâ
- Credits menu replicated straight from Psych Engine!

‚ÑπÔ∏è This port also has several following downsides:
- This port doesn't have songs that were embedded in the original mod, the ones that weren't present in the mod's game files
- This port is made for an FNF' engine that is by now completely abandoned, but was not at all back when this port had initially started being developed. Take that into account when thinking how much this engine can do as it has a lot of messy code and poor optimization
